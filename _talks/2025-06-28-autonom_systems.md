The tutorial provides an overview of the development of intelligent autonomous assistants, focusing on how multimodal AI technologies—such as large language models, computer vision, and robotics—enable systems to understand language, perceive their environment, plan actions, and manipulate objects. It discusses practical applications in Industry 5.0, logistics, laboratories, smart homes, and agriculture, and contrasts modular system designs with end-to-end vision-language-action models. Finally, it highlights current research challenges, including data scarcity, simulation-to-reality transfer, system speed, and robustness in complex real-world environments.
