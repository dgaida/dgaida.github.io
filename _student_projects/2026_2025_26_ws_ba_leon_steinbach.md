title: "AlphaZero für Blokus-Duo: Analyse und Vergleich mit Minimax- und MCTS-Algorithmen"
author: "Leon Steinbach"
date: "2026-02-01"
excerpt: |
  Mr Steinbach taught an AlphaZero AI to play the two-player board game Blokus Duo by pure self-play, pitting it against conventional Minimax and Monte-Carlo agents. After ten training cycles the neural network still loses to the classics, yet already boosts standard MCTS strength and shows clear room for further learning.
