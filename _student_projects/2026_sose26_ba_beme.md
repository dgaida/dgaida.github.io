excerpt: |
  A fast machine-learning “meta-model” was trained with active-learning tricks to imitate Europe’s slow groundwater-exposure model for pesticides. The resulting CatBoost committee predicts concentrations in real time with under 0.7 % error, enabling instant, low-cost screening of crop-protection products.
