title: "Autonomous Object Detection and Manipulation Using a Mobile Cobot"
author: "Tim Yago Nordhoff"
date: "2026-01-07"
excerpt: |
  Tim Nordhoff’s thesis shows how a small mobile robot can wander through an unfamiliar room, spot any object you describe in plain words, and safely pick it up. All the needed mapping, navigation, vision and grasping run entirely on the robot itself; tests in two indoor settings confirm the system reliably finds and grabs the target faster and more often than simpler approaches.
