excerpt: |
  A voice-controlled web tool has been created that lets users manage Discord events and channels through everyday speech, automatically converting phrases like “tomorrow 3 pm” into the exact timestamps Discord needs. The system links large language models to Discord’s servers via the open Model Context Protocol, hides the technical details behind a simple browser interface, and can be used from any device on the network.
