title: "AlphaZero für Blokus-Duo: Analyse und Vergleich mit Minimax- und MCTS-Algorithmen"
author: "L. S."

excerpt: |
  An AlphaZero-style AI for the two-player board game Blokus Duo was built and pitted against hand-crafted Minimax and MCTS opponents. Although ten rounds of self-training did not yet surpass the classical agents, the neural network noticeably boosted MCTS move quality, indicating clear room for further improvement.
