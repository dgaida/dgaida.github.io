excerpt: |
  Autonomous exploration, open-vocabulary object recognition, and safe grasping have been combined on a compact mobile robot, enabling it to independently map unknown rooms, locate user-specified items, and pick them up. Field tests showed the frontier-guided strategy finds and grasps objects faster and more reliably than simpler straight-line searches, even in cluttered indoor spaces.

Autonomous exploration, open-vocabulary object recognition, and safe grasping have been combined on a compact mobile robot, enabling it to independently map unknown rooms, locate user-specified items, and pick them up. Field tests showed the frontier-guided strategy finds and grasps objects faster and more reliably than simpler straight-line searches, even in cluttered indoor spaces.
