title: "Active Learning Framework for a Meta-Model to Predict Concentrations of Pesticides in Groundwater"
author: "Ben Konrad Meyer"
date: "2026-01-22"
excerpt: |
  Ben Konrad Meyer’s bachelor thesis presents a fast machine-learning “meta-model” that quickly estimates pesticide concentrations in groundwater. By combining active-learning sampling and a committee of CatBoost models, the tool predicts the official PELMO simulation results in milliseconds instead of seconds, enabling rapid early safety screens for new crop-protection products.
